### Airbnb NYC Data Analysis Project

**Project Summary**
This project explores Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and geographic distribution. Using Python and Tableau, I performed exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and clustering to better understand how factors like location, room type, and reviews affect listing prices.

**Data Source**
Airbnb Open Data NYC from Kaggle
NYC sales data were used for geographic visualizations from Kaggle

**Purpose of the Analysis**
The goal of this project is to help stakeholders (e.g., potential Airbnb hosts or market researchers) understand:
What factors influence listing prices?
How listings are geographically clustered across boroughs
Whether linear or non-linear patterns exist in pricing
Key recommendations for data-driven pricing decisions

Viewers of this analysis will learn how data science techniques (EDA, regression, clustering) can be applied to real-world data to extract actionable insights.
